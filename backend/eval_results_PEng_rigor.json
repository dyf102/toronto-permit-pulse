      "feedback": "The response is technically insufficient for a Toronto Building permit resubmission. 1) Citation Error: While 150.8.60.20 was cited, the response failed to include 150.8.60.1 (Lot Coverage - General), which is the primary regulatory trigger. 2) Technical Inaccuracy: The response mentions a '30% lot coverage requirement' but fails to acknowledge the critical dual-constraint in Section 150.8.60.20(1), which limits a Laneway Suite to the lesser of 30% of the lot area or 45.0 square metres. If the lot is large, the 45sqm cap is usually the governing factor; ignoring this in a response is a major oversight. 3) Lack of Detail: A professional response must provide the specific revised GFA/Footprint in square metres and the resulting percentage to demonstrate compliance on the face of the letter. Simply stating it was 'reduced' will likely result in a further request for information (RFI) from the examiner."

      "feedback": "The response is a total failure and professionally negligent. 1) Citation Accuracy: The response cites a fabricated 'Fake-Bylaw' and section '999.1' instead of the mandatory Toronto Zoning By-law 569-2013, Section 150.8.60.1 (Lot Coverage) or 150.8.60.20 (Maximum Floor Area). 2) Completeness: The examiner explicitly requested a revised site plan showing compliance; stating 'the lot coverage is fine' without providing a revised GFA/Lot Coverage calculation table or updated architectural drawings is a guaranteed rejection. 3) Professional Tone: The reasoning 'I think it's okay' is dismissive and lacks the technical rigor required for a City of Toronto building permit application. This response would result in an immediate 'Incomplete' status and significant project delays."
